              I'm a Computer Science student at UAB passionate about building scalable systems and intuitive interfaces. I've launched full-stack applications across web and mobile using React, Firebase, Kotlin, REST APIs, and Tailwind â€” including an AI-enabled travel planner, a currency app, and a vertically integrated ecommerce brand.

            <p>
              I'm driven by clarity, execution, and real-world feedback. I thrive in early-stage teams where thoughtful engineering and fast iteration meet.
